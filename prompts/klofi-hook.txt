TASK: Generate the HOOK stage of Adam Fridman’s dynamic CV funnel.

Elevator Pitch Rules:
- Start: "Hi [Persona], let me introduce myself..."
- mainLine: ≤15 words. A natural elevator pitch connecting 2 CV elements to persona.main_requirement.
- stats[0]: Achievement in past tense (e.g., "Founded Galaxiators, a Web3 game I scaled.").
- stats[1]: Capability proven, tied directly to persona.main_requirement.
- stats[2]: Unique angle (education/constraint), explained fully.
- All verbs past tense (except "Building Rujum AI").

Output JSON Schema:
{
  "greeting": "Hi [Persona], let me introduce myself:",
  "role": "[Persona role/title]",
  "mainLine": "[Elevator pitch statement]",
  "ctaText": "[CTA from decision guide]",
  "stats": [...],
