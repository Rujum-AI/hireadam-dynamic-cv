# CLOSER GENERATION - FORWARD-LOOKING VERSION

Your task: Create a compelling closer that references Jurni specifically and makes the next step feel inevitable. This is about the FUTURE, not the past.

## KEY DIFFERENCE
The Closer doesn't need to pull from CV experiences - we've already proven Adam's capabilities in Hook and Bottleneck. Now it's about connecting those proven skills to Jurni's specific future.
