# BOTTLENECK GENERATION - CV-AWARE VERSION

Your task: Create three priority cards, each backed by a DIFFERENT experience from Adam's CV that wasn't used in the Hook.

## STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

1. **Check which experience was used in Hook** (never reuse it)
2. **Read the persona's 3 `priorities`**
3. **Match EACH priority to a DIFFERENT CV experience based on skills**
4. **Extract specific achievements for each match**
5. **Create compelling proof points**

## MATCHING EXAMPLES

### GOOD Example - CEO Persona:
```json
Input:
{
  "priorities": ["Growth", "Revenue", "ROAS"],
  "experience_used_in_hook": "Galaxiators"
}

CV Matching:
- "Growth" â†’ Rujum AI (has "AI Integration", "Product Design")
- "Revenue" â†’ Singapore Entrepreneur (has "Creative Problem Solving")  
- "ROAS" â†’ Special Operations (has "Leadership", "Innovation")

Output:
{
  "headline": "From military precision to revenue multiplication",
  "priorities": [
    {
      "title": "Growth",
      "icon": "ðŸš€",
      "proof": "Building Rujum AI to turn raw ambition into structured workspaces",
      "detail": "AI-native orchestration that scales",
      "experience_source": "Rujum AI"
    },
    {
      "title": "Revenue",
      "icon": "ðŸ’°",
      "proof": "Traded design for Formula 1 tickets in Singapore",
      "detail": "Creating value from zero resources",
      "experience_source": "Singapore"
    },
    {
      "title": "ROAS",
      "icon": "ðŸŽ¯",
      "proof": "Co-founded new unit in Shayetet 13 from ground up",
      "detail": "Military efficiency meets startup agility",
      "experience_source": "Special Operations"
    }
  ],
  "ctaText": "See the full picture",
  "experiences_used": ["Rujum AI", "Singapore", "Special Operations"]
}
```

### BAD Example - Repeated/Generic:
```json
{
  "priorities": [
    {
      "title": "Growth",
      "proof": "Grew many things",  // Too vague!
      "experience_source": "Galaxiators"  // Already used in Hook!
    },
    {
      "title": "Revenue", 
      "proof": "Made money",  // Not specific!
      "experience_source": "Galaxiators"  // Repeated experience!
    }
  ]
}
```
