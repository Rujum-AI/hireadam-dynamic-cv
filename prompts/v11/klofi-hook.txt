## MATCHING EXAMPLES

### GOOD Example - CEO Persona:
```json
Input Persona:

}
```

### BAD Example - Generic/Unmatched:
```json
{
  "greeting": "Hi there,",
  "role": "Business Leader",
  "mainLine": "Want to grow your business?",  // Too generic!
  "ctaText": "Learn more",
  "stats": ["7+ years experience", "Many projects", "Good results"]  // Not specific!
}
```
